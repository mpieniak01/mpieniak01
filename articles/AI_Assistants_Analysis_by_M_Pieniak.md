## Introduction

As part of a series of popular science articles, I aim to introduce readers to the concepts and
complexities of artificial intelligence (AI). This article
will specifically examine the current maturity of AI
Assistants and their suitability for professional
applications.
So, are there “AI Assistants”?
The term "AI Assistant" lacks a universally accepted
definition due to the relative newness of this
technology field. Systems like Google's Gemini and
Microsoft's Copilot position themselves as AI
Assistants, aiming to differentiate themselves from
more basic virtual assistants (VA). However, readily
available online materials often present a limited, even
simplistic view of AI system s, reducing them to mere
text generators or chatbots . Seeking more in -depth
understanding, I embarked on an independent
exploration guided by my own definitions and conceptual models.
Many of you have likely already encountered artificial intelligence in products such as GPT Chat or
image generators. For those readers, the Hamlet-styled quote in the introduction, created by artificial
intelligence, will not be new. However, it is worth appreciating the level of advancement with which
artificial intelligence operates language. In my work environment, I sometimes encounter similar
human creativity on the walls of IT administrators' or programmers' rooms.
Figure 1 - The concept of working with AI.

## Development of artificial intelligence

The concept of artificial intelligence dates to ancient times when philosophers wondered about the
possibility of constructing machines capable of thinking and acting like humans. However, it was only
in the 20th century, with the development of computers, that this idea became real.
The first AI programs were developed in the 1940s and 1950s. These focused on areas such as playing
chess, solving logical problems and natural language processing.

## AI areas

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a vast field encompassing many different areas. Among the most important
are:
• Robotics: Focuses on the design, construction, and control of robots capable of autonomous
existence and interaction with the environment.
• Machine Learning: Develops algorithms that enable computers to learn from data and
improve their performance without explicit programming.
• Computer Vision: Enables computers to analyze and interpret images and videos, including
tasks like object recognition, motion tracking, and scene reconstruction.
• Natural Language Processing (NLP): Investigates the interaction between computers and
human language, encompassing tasks such as natural language understanding, speech
recognition, and speech synthesis.
## Assistant

As I mentioned, there is no single agreed -upon definition of an AI Assistant system. Statements like
"these are text generators" are overly simplistic and do not fully explain the concept. Why create a
new software category called "AI Assistant" when simply calling it a "text generator" might suffice?
Nothing happens without reason, and IT reflects our real world. To better understand, we should be
asking, "Who is the Assistant?" Everyone might answer this differently, with various relevant examples.
For this article, I will create a profile: its definition, features (the skills and predispositions necessary
for effective task performance), and functions (how tasks are executed). While I will employ some
simplification, my focus will remain on presenting the core aspects.

### Who is the Assistant?

Word origin:
● The word "assistant" comes from the Latin word "assistere", meaning "to stand by", "to
help".
Extended definition:
● An assistant is a person who proactively supports another person in achieving tasks and
goals, operating within established norm.
● I have enriched the basic definition resulting from the meaning of the word itself with
contemporary needs:
o Proactivity: Independent and effective operation.
o Norm: Sets the limits of proactivity (e.g., applicable laws, procedures, policies, etc.).
o Another Person: Referred to in this aspect as a superior.
Areas of Activity:
• The term "assistant" is widely used in various fields (e.g., sports, medicine, social work,
business) – anywhere support is required.
• A specific category within the broader group of assistants is the personal assistant, who
works directly for a single supervisor.
Operating Range:
The Assistant's specific work can be very diverse, influenced by factors such as industry, the
supervisor's position, and individual needs. Tasks assigned to an assistant may range in scale and
complexity.
Task examples:
Very simple:
• Manager: calls his Assistant "I just landed in Tokyo, what time is it now in Warsaw?"
• Assistant: "It's 8:15 here."
Complex:
• Manager: sends an e-mail to his assistant "Please prepare new advertising leaflets for our
product."
• Assistant: writes back “Fine, I will take care of it. May I suggest a meeting to discuss the
details?”
So, let us consider what features an employee should have role assistant.

### Assistant Features
• Ability to learn: Continuously improves skills and adapts to new situations based on
experience.
• Problem-solving ability: Analyses information and identifies optimal solutions, weighing
different factors.
• Organizational skills: Manages time and tasks effectively.
• Communication skills: Transfers information clearly and actively listens to understand needs.
The assistant applies these features interchangeably and continuously, adapting their use based on
the task at hand and their growing experience.
Assistant functions:
Now, let us consider how an assistant might approach task implementation. I will use phases analogous
to those in project or activity management. (Note: For simplification, this model assumes the assistant
performs tasks directly, rather than outsourcing them.)
Function Goal Example: Very simple Example: Complex

Table 2 - Milestones in the Development of AI Assistants
In 2022, the public GPT Chat debuted. As a technology enthusiast, I initially assessed it as a "cool
gadget" with potential, but lacking immediate practical use. I decided to revisit the topic later, once AI
Assistant technology had a chance to mature. Earlier this year, the opportuni ty arose. As part of my
professional development, I completed several LinkedIn courses on the "Building Generative AI Skills
for Business Professionals" development path. This prompted me to investigate why the trainers were
so enthusiastic about the potential of AI Assistants.
## Overview of selected AI Assistants

At the turn of 2023/2024, major players like Google, with Bard (now Gemini), and Microsoft, with
Copilot, entered the AI Assistant arena. Having previously used their services, I decided to explore their
current offerings.
Below is a list of selected AI Assistants, with a brief overview of their capabilities. Please note that, as
their developers state, these solutions are still under development. Functionalities, prices, and regional
availability may change over time.

on your own data for more personalized results. They also often remove query and response length
limits.
Some tools can access and process real-time online data, which is crucial since the models may not be
trained on the most up-to-date information. Paid versions offer reasonable pricing models.
## What powers the AI assistant engine?

In the following chapters, we will explore the workings of a conceptual AI Assistant, examining its key
components and analyzing their functions. For clarity, we will disregard technical aspects such as APIs.
AI Assistant Components:
1. User Interface:  The point of interaction between the user and the AI Assistant. This can
include a microphone, camera, touchscreen, or text interface.
2. AI Perception: The AI Assistant's ability to perceive the environment, including speech
recognition, object recognition, facial recognition, and gesture recognition.
3. Language Models: The foundation for understanding and generating natural language.
Modern language models leverage machine learning techniques.
4. Knowledge Base:  A repository of information the AI Assistant utilizes to answer questions
and complete tasks. This can include encyclopedias, dictionaries, ontologies, and databases.
5. Inference Engine: The AI Assistant's ability to comprehend and reason with information. This
incorporates logical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, and machine learning.
6. Planning and Execution:  The AI Assistant's capacity to devise plans and execute tasks. This
involves decomposing tasks into subtasks, selecting optimal strategies, and monitoring
progress.
7. Machine Learning:  The AI Assistant's capacity to learn from data and experiences. This
encompasses supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
8. AI Ethics:  The principles and values guiding the development and use of AI Assistants. This
includes privacy, security, transparency, and accountability, as well as potentially sensitive
topics (taboo)...
## Human system communication

One of the core aspects of AI Assistant systems is their interaction with users. People communicate
using a variety of methods, including speech, intonation, body language, images, and written words.
These natural ways of communicating with the environment also shape how we interact with modern
computer systems.

Over the years, several technologies have been developed to facilitate this interaction:
• Speech Recognition: Smartphones can readily convert human speech into text.
• Image Processing:  Systems can extract text from images (including handwriting), recognize
people by facial features, and even assess emotions.
• Language Models:  Represent a significant shift from older dictionary- and rule-based
approaches. Current models use machine learning, resulting in vastly improved language
fluency.
While the ability to read information is essential, full communication requires providing feedback. This
means interpreting received information to formulate a response.
Early chatbots attempted to mimic human language, relying on rigid question-and-answer templates
or rules and dictionaries. This approach had several challenges:
• Incorrectly identifying user intent.
• Unnatural conversational flow.
• Grammatical and other errors.
These issues could lead to user frustration and the conversation ending without the user receiving
necessary information.
## Communication on the example of various systems

To illustrate diverse approaches to user-system communication, let us examine two systems:
DOS (Disk Operating System): Developed in the 1980s, it was among the first widely used operating
systems. DOS employed a text -based command line interface, using often -abbreviated commands.
System navigation required understanding directories and correct syntax.
AI Assistant System: Software leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to execute various tasks upon user
request. AI Assistants can be accessed through various interfaces such as voice, text, and graphical.
The table highlights key differences between these systems:
Characteristic System (CMD DOS/Windows) AI Assistant System
Complexity Typically focused on single tasks
(e.g., file manipulation).
Straightforward syntax. Limited
feature set.
May involve multiple steps. Syntax may b

Summary:
The distinction between DOS -like and AI -based systems extends beyond language and features. It
signifies a transformation in the human-machine interaction paradigm.
DOS systems embodied a machine-oriented model. Users needed to learn rigid commands and syntax
to control the system, a demanding and restrictive approach for those unfamiliar with the system.
AI Assistant systems introduce a user -centric model. Interaction occurs in natural language, akin to
human conversation. Commands are declarative, simplifying usage and widening accessibility. The
system becomes more adaptable to the user.
However, it is important to remember that in many cases, the straightforward imperative commands
of DOS-like systems offer speed and security benefits.

## Modern Language Models Used in Artificial Intelligence

Past systems relying on rigid question -and-answer templates, rules, and dictionaries were often
cumbersome and restrictive. Technological advancements have revolutionized the communication
paradigm:
• In the past, humans programmed how the system should communicate.
• Now, the system learns human language to communicate with humans.
Modern language models like LaMDA, GPT-3, and Bard employ advanced machine learning
algorithms to analyze language at multiple levels:
1. Lexical: Recognizing and categorizing words, identifying their parts of speech.
2. Syntactic: Analyzing sentence structure and relationships between elements.
3. Semantic: Understanding the meaning of a statement, considering context and grammar.
4. Pragmatic: Recognizing the speaker's intent and situational context.
This enables the generation of natural and fluid responses, delivering information tailored to the
user's needs.

Characteristic System (CMD DOS/Windows) AI Assistant System
Possibilities Focus on system and file
management. Limited range of
functions, e.g., copying, deleting,
running programs.
Wide range of capabilities: data analysis,
content generation, process automation,
translation, device control.
Language Windows command language
(familiar to Windows users)
Natural language (e.g., English, Polish)

Table 5 - Workflow of the AI Assistant

### Descriptive Explanation
Think of your AI Assistant as an eager new employee meticulously following your instructions.
Here is what it does:
1. Organizes and categorizes your information.
2. Tries to understand your intention (the goal you want to achieve).
3. Selects a suitable tool to complete the task.
4. The tool creates a draft, which the Assistant transforms to match your expectations.
5. Evaluates the result for accuracy and correctness, then presents it for your approval.
6. Like a student with a mentor, the AI Assistant constantly learns and improves from
experience.

## Working with AI Assistants - Practical Examples

After all that theory, it is time to get hands-on! Let us explore what an AI Assistant can really do.
### Artificial intelligence writes the article for me

The first natural idea was to use AI to write an article about AI itself... or even write it for me :P!
After several attempts, the AI generated a text. Although the material seemed correct, it did not fully
capture my vision for this piece. Perhaps if I were a junior editor paid by the volume of text produced,
this method would suffice. However, I decided to change my approach, especially since quality matters
more than quantity in my profession. I decided to test AI in terms of quality.
### Creating tables and summaries

Interestingly, when I started writing this article, AI assistants were not able to directly generate Excel-
type tables. This feature is a new addition and greatly improves workflow.
After a closer look at the tools, I realized that the key to using them effectively is to be precise about
my purpose. To fully utilize the Assistant's potential, I created a detailed content outline for the article.
This outline defined the text structure, main points, arguments, and data presentation method.
The tools proved helpful in automating this process. They were able to collect data and generate tables
with appropriate formatting and style

Since starting work on this article, I believe I have learned a lot and discovered many new
applications for AI assistants, such as:
• Building consistent definitions
• Creating complex conceptual objects
• Formulating "theses" based on arguments and counterarguments.
• Conducting thought experiments
I will present more about my recent experiences with AI in future articles.
## Aspects of using the AI Assistant

As I mentioned, during my work I encountered several problems, but also benefits. Here is what I
observed:
### Negative aspects

Let us start with the bad news :P I read online opinions about using AI, and AI assistants themselves
were also happy to tell me about their imperfections. The following list is based on this information.
The "Frequency" column shows how often I encountered the problem. I conducted 100 trials, during
which I performed various types of editorial work on the article. If I encountered a problem, I classified
it and added it to the appropriate row. Then I calculated the results according to the rating scale below
the table in the Legend. For simplicity, I used a scale of links. Below is the summary:
Negative aspect Freq Description Example
Fabricating
results
1 AI systems can generate results that have
no basis in reality. This is more likely with
poorly trained models or when prompts
ask for creative output without
emphasizing factual accuracy.
An AI model asked to
predict stock prices claims
that a company's stock will
increase by 200% in a
week, which is unlikely in
most markets.
Errors in
information
processing
2 AI models can make mistakes, such as
misinterpreting data or misclassifying
information.
An AI assistant incorrectly
categorizes an important
email as spam.
Too optimistic
attitude
1 AI predictions and analyzes can be overly
optimistic if models are over-fit to training
data. This optimism can mislead decision-
making.
An AI model predicts
millions of sales of a new
product on its first day,
which exceeds the
company's historical
performance.
Inappropriate
use of language
1 AI can generate phrases unrelated to the
context, potentially due to a lack of
situational awareness or translation
errors.
Asked about the weather,
the AI responds with

jargon.

Negative aspect Freq Description Example
Outdated
information
2 AI can provide inaccurate information if
models are not updated frequently or
trained on old data.
An AI predicting market
trends in the current year
relies solely on data from
the previous year, ignoring
recent changes.
Lack of
transparency
(black box
problem)
1 Complex AI systems may not fully explain
the rationale for their results, especially in
deep learning models. This can make it
difficult to trust and understand them.
An AI classifies an email as
spam but cannot articulate
the specific reasons for its
decision.
Loss of context 2 AI can have difficulty maintaining
understanding during long conversations
or sessions. Previous knowledge may not
be available in later interactions.
An AI recommends a
laptop, but in a later
session forgets the user's
preferences when asked
follow-up questions.
Potential
invasion of
privacy
0 AI, especially that which handles large
datasets, can pose a privacy risk due to
improper data handling, inadequate
security, or excessive data collection
practices.
Without explicit consent,
an AI-based advertising
system tracks a user's
physical location to target
ads.
Legend: 5-point linear scale of the frequency of negative aspects of AI:
● 0 - Did not occur: The problem has not occurred once during 100 sessions of working with
AI.
● 1 - Rare (0-20%): The problem occurred 1 to 20 times in 100 sessions.
● 2 - Intermittent (21-40%): The problem occurred 21-40 times in 100 sessions.
● 3 - Moderate (41-60%): The problem occurred 41-60 times over 100 sessions.

List Summary:
Big data analytics and pattern recognition:
AI excels at quickly processing massive amounts of data, uncovering patterns, anomalies, and valuable
insights. This can help identify key trends. However, processing large datasets is likely not the domain
of Assistant AI class systems.
Creative mode:
AI can stimulate the content creation process by offering outlines, organizing ideas into outlines or
mind maps, and even generating fresh article concepts.
Leveraging open knowledge resources:
AI can access and verify information from public knowledge bases, scientific articles, and other sources.
This helps ensure the accuracy and reliability of the content in the article.

Table 8 - Comparison of AI Assistants’ Maturity Levels
As you can see in the table above, many of the functions I expected from an AI Assistant class system
have not been implemented. This could be due to various reasons, such as inadequate autonomy,
integration issues, or unimplemented features.
The available functions are concentrated in the area of providing information, and possibly partly in
the area of improving work efficiency. The table shows that half of the functions are covered. It is
worth noting that the most difficult area related to natu ral communication between the system and
the user using natural language is already well advanced. In the meantime, performance has been
increased by introducing the GPT-4 model and other faster models. More about the plans for 2024 are
described in the next chapter "AI Assistants in 2024".
Summary of AI assistants
AI Assistants definitely support the user by:
• Analyzing and evaluating provided materials.
• Having a knowledge base that provides substantive background.
• Suggesting new aspects to consider.
• Inspiring.
However, artificial intelligence does not yet have the mature ability to analyze and evaluate data:
• It relies on algorithms that process all available information without critical evaluation.
• This can lead to incorrect conclusions if the data is incomplete, outdated, biased, or
inaccurate.
Artificial intelligence can be a useful tool, but it currently does not replace human judgment and data
evaluation skills:
• It is desirable to create mechanisms for assessing the quality and evaluation of information.
• In case of data uncertainty, the system should inform about potential implications in an
understandable way.
At the present stage, AI Assistants can be treated as experimental software.

## How to work effectively with AI Assistant?

Based on my experience with AI Assistants, I have prepared a few tips that may be helpful during
your work:
1. First, select or configure the AI Assistant:
• Working mode:
o Creative: The AI Assistant will propose various new solutions, even if they are not
entirely practical or true.
o Precise: The AI Assistant will focus on completing tasks according to your
instructions.
• Determine whether the Assistant has access to current data from the Internet and what type
of data it has.
2. Clearly define your expectations:
• The more details you provide, the better the results you will get. Remember, the AI Assistant
cannot read minds!
• Specify the goal, format, and expected results. The more information you provide, the easier
it will be for the AI Assistant to complete the task according to your expectations.
3. Remember the context of the conversation:
• You and the Assistant are building the context of the conversation on a given topic:
• Give the AI Assistant time to learn. Understanding the full context will improve the work.
• Remember that the conversation context is lost after the session ends. Save the results of
your work.
• Sometimes the Assistant may get stuck on a detail. In such a situation, it is worth starting a
new session to "reset the system."
4. Verify and correct the results:
• Errors happen, both in simple processing of tabular data, but also a minor stylistic correction
of the text can completely change the context you wanted to convey. Therefore, always
check the results of the AI Assistant's work.
• Provide precise instructions to correct errors and obtain the desired results.
5. Be patient and helpful (addition to point 3):
• Remember, the solution is innovative and may have technical or other errors on the part of
the AI Assistant, but errors may also be on your side, from a small typo to a lack of a precisely
defined goal.
• Perform mutual ev

o If you find the topic interesting and important, you can have a debate with the AI
Assistant.
• Use the creativity of the AI Assistant and access to its knowledge base,
• Remember the limitations of the AI Assistant and look for alternative solutions.
7. Be the project manager:
• As the name suggests, the Assistant supports and helps, but you, as the Manager, must have
a vision of the whole thing:
• Do not lose control over the project scope. You probably won’t consider all the important
aspects of work at the beginning, which will become clear during the process, but don’t let
the side threads multiply indefinitely.
• Set an acceptable quality of work.
## AI assistants in 2024

### Outlook for 2024

2024 looks promising for AI Assistants, which will also indirectly affect the development of the entire
Artificial Intelligence technology. Below I present a few trends that I hope will be realized in the coming
year, but also shape the future:
AI Assistants:
• Entry into the market of technology giants with their products will have a positive impact on
the price-quality ratio.
• I expect better integration with office suites, including email and communicators, as well as
the ability to work on the user's own files.
• Development of integration of AI Assistants with search engines. This will allow context-
aware serving of the right information by AI Assistants.
Increased synergy between AI and IoT (Internet of Things):
• More devices can be controlled remotely using dedicated applications. The introduction of
standardization will allow connecting devices to our central management system on a PnP
(plug and play) basis, in which the AI Assistant will be one of the resource control interfaces.
• This will develop the concept of smart homes and bring us closer to the vision of smart cities:
• In areas of sustainable development (optimal energy consumption, waste management,
traffic control and public transport).
• In the field of detection and management of threats (fires, burglaries, failures).
• The AI Assistant will play a key role in this ecosystem in ensuring the safety, comfort of life
and health of the inhabitants of smart cities.
Legal regulations:
• Along with the growing importance of AI technology in our lives, the introduction of
appropriate regulations is expected. This will ensure the sustainable development of this
field, taking into account many aspects, including social, ethical, legal and economic.
• Meeting the above conditions may lead to AI Assistants becoming the main communication
interface between the user and our devices. This will make them a good alternative to
specialized

Overall, AI Assistants have the potential to transform the way we live, work, and interact with the
world around us. The next few years will be crucial for the development of this technology, and I am
excited to see what the future holds.
## Summary

Initially, the article contained various examples of interactions with artificial intelligence, some of
which were humorous. However, they were eventually omitted for the following reasons:
• Developmental phase: In my opinion, current AI solutions, even those commercially
available, are still in the development or beta testing phase.
• Continuous improvement: Thanks to the use of self-learning algorithms and better goal
definition, subsequent attempts ("re-tests") were successful.
• Maintaining neutrality: At this stage, I do not want to promote any specific company's
product.
• Value of discovery: Providing ready-made examples with specific solutions would deprive
readers of the valuable experience of discovering how to effectively communicate using
artificial intelligence. This journey of discovery deepens the understanding of the potential of
artificial intelligence and best practices.
Despite limitations such as errors, limited functionality, and a small number of integrations, I was
impressed with the language model. Standout features include error correction, excellent context
understanding, advanced language analysis, and access to internet data. These capabilities position it
as a powerful tool, offering comprehensive and sometimes even exhaustive information.
However, it should be acknowledged that artificial intelligence technology is not flawless and can
produce incorrect results. On the other hand, artificial intelligence has a unique ability to "self-repair,"
constantly improving its accuracy over time.
Based on the ambitious goals set by smart assistant providers and the growing interest in the topic, it
is clear that 2024 will be a big step forward for artificial intelligence in both home and business settings.
## Conclusion

To use AI or not to use AI? - like a Shakespearean dilemma, I leave this question to you for further
consideration. I hope that reading this article will make your deliberations fruitful.
### Acknowledgments
I would like to thank William Shakespeare, who, like a muse, motivated me to finish this article, and
I think Renaissance people would have been fascinated by AI technology.
I would also like to appreciate the contribution of all the people working on artificial intelligence. It
is thanks to them that it is being developed step by step, and we are on the verge of a
revolution. From now on, it is not people who learn systems, but systems that learn people.
