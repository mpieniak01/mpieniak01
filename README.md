### Hi, I'm Maciej Pieniak

AI Systems Architect and Business/System Analyst.
I build local-first AI systems that focus on decision quality, context handling, and controllable autonomy.

### What I Build

My projects are practical experiments in one question:
How to design AI that is useful in production, but still predictable and auditable?

Main direction:

- **[Venom](https://github.com/mpieniak01/Venom)**: AI control architecture for planning, execution, and decision tracing.
- **[Rider-Pi](https://github.com/mpieniak01/Rider-Pi)**: embedded control stack for a self-balancing robot.
- **[Rider-Pc](https://github.com/mpieniak01/Rider-Pc)**: companion control server with heavier AI workloads offloaded from the robot.

### What Is Different Here

Compared to many AI repositories focused only on prompts or model wrappers, I focus on:

- **Decision flow, not only generation**: plan -> act -> verify loops.
- **Traceability**: system behavior should be inspectable after execution.
- **Autonomy boundaries**: explicit limits, permission checks, and safety gates.
- **Cross-layer design**: from embedded robotics to orchestration APIs and governance.

Core goal: build AI systems that can be trusted operationally, not only demoed.
