### Hi, I'm Maciej Pieniak 👋

AI Systems Architect · Business & System Analyst  
I design autonomous, local-first AI systems focused on **decision-making**, **context**,
and the **limits of artificial intelligence**.

My work connects theory (perception, heuristics, ethics) with practical system architecture.

### 🚀 Current Focus: VENOM

**Venom Meta-Intelligence** is an experimental AI system created to answer a simple question:

> *How should an AI system make decisions when reality is uncertain, context-dependent and imperfect?*

Venom explores:
- decision processes instead of raw generation,
- memory and knowledge hygiene,
- tolerance, evaluation and responsibility,
- human-in-the-loop control.

The project is intentionally **local-first** and **non-product** —  
it serves as an architectural reference for future autonomous systems,
where decision quality matters more than raw performance.

### 🧬 Evolution: From Hardware to Meta-Intelligence

My journey into AI architecture started with building physical agents.  
**Venom** is the natural evolution of these projects — moving from *controlling* a system
to *understanding how it decides*.

* **1. [Rider-Pi](https://github.com/mpieniak01/Rider-Pi)** — *The Body*  
  Embedded Python logic for a self-balancing robot.  
  Real-time sensor fusion, motor control and local execution.

* **2. [Rider-PC](https://github.com/mpieniak01/Rider-PC)** — *The Brain*  
  FastAPI-based control server and AI provider replicating the robot’s nervous system.  
  Heavy ML workloads (vision, voice) offloaded to a dedicated unit.

* **3. Venom** — *The Conscience*  
  Abstracting decision-making logic into a standalone meta-system focused on
  evaluation, tolerance and responsibility.
